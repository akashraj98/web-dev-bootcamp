        Sprigatito is a quadrupedal feline Pokémon covered in pale green fur. The fur's composition is similar to that of plants, allowing it to absorb sunlight for energy.[1] It has green ears with pale green insides,
        a tuft of fur on the front of its chest and a green marking around its pink eyes and nose that resemble leaves. When its mouth is open, two pointed teeth can be seen in its upper jaw. It has a fluffy tail and small paws with no visible toes.
